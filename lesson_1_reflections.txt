    It's very useful for me to learn FC and diff command, when using this two commands
,I can easily checkout the difference between two files.It' more directly!
    From long to see, when we could review all version in our file's history, we can manage our files more easily
,and more efficiency.
	It's more clear to make a commit by logical than by an fixed interval, but for someone lazy, commit by interval will help you to remember to do so.
